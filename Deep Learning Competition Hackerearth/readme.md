This was a Hackearearth Deeplearning challenge

The objective of this competition was to Classify images into four classes.
The classes were Food, Attire, Misc, Decoration.

The basic approach was to try out different networks and fine tune them to this dataset as there are not a lot of images available.
Training a network from the beginning is not feasible.

For pre processing the images were resized according to the CNN used and adding gaussian noise to add rhobustness.

I trained models like Efficientnet B5, B3, Xception net and Inception Net

The best performance was of Efficientnet
